# DISC Privacy Policy
- This shows what info we collect, how it's stored, and what we do with it (we don't do much!)
- This privacy policy can change at any time, you are responsible for checking the changes and accepting them, we are not to be held liable.

# Discs (DIP files)
Local discs (created in YOUR server) are stored unencrypted but hidden from the public. Only people with access to the server can see them.

DISC's server uses encrypted private keys to authenticate through SSH. Our server has been stress-tested and appears to fit at least average security qualifications.

# Messages sent (This could be prone to change.)
We do not store messages sent, we only check them for commands, (e.g. insert disc burger, burn disc yummy,) we do not store message data in server storage.

# Usernames (This could be prone to change.)
Usernames are not stored in our server's storage, only if you have administrator access and add discs to DISC-DB will you have your username stored and even then it will only be stored publicly on Github.

# User IDs (This could be prone to change.)
User IDs are checked to see if you're an administrator for DISC, this is only used to check if you are able to access administrator commands. We do not store this data in our server.
